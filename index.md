About the Awesome Support REST API
----------------------------

Awesome Support is moving towards becoming a fully-fledged application framework, and we needed new APIs. This project was born to create an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand and well-tested framework interacting with Awesome Support data.

The Awesome Support REST API provides an easy-to-use set of HTTP endpoints that let you access your site's data in simple JSON format, including tickets, settings, and more. Retrieving or updating data is as simple as sending a HTTP request.

Want to get your site's tickets? Simply send a `GET` request to `/wp-json/wpas-api/v1/tickets`. It's that easy.
